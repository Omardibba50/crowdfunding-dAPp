The service exported by this module attempts to configure NAT hole punching
via UPnP.

This will make your node publicly accessible from the internet.

For this to work there are some prerequisites:

1. Your router must have UPnP support enabled
2. Your libp2p node must be listening on a non-loopback IPv4 address
3. You must not be [double-NATed](https://kb.netgear.com/30186/What-is-double-NAT-and-why-is-it-bad) by your ISP

## Example

```typescript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { tcp } from '@libp2p/tcp'
import { uPnPNAT } from '@libp2p/upnp-nat'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  addresses: {
    listen: [
      '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0'
    ]
  },
  transports: [
    tcp()
  ],
  services: {
    upnpNAT: uPnPNAT()
  }
})
```

# Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/upnp-nat
```
